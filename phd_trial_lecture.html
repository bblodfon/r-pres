## Why study cancer?

- **2nd cause of death worldwide** .small.purple[Ritchie &amp; Roser (2018)]
  - Problem exacerbates due to aging and population growth
- Curing every cancer type is impossible

## Why is cancer challenging?

- Research findings are **not translational**
  - *In-vitro* and *in-vivo* approaches are .red[not effective] in the clinic
  - .red[&lt; 4% of drugs succeed] in clinical trials .small.purple[Wong (2019)]
  - Need for .green[basic science] and .green[integrative (in-silico) approaches]
- **High complexity**
  - Multiscale process
  - Heterogeneity .small.purple[Senft (2017)]
      - Intra-tumor (within a patient)
      - Inter-tumor (patients diversity)
- **Acquired resistance to therapy**
- **Lack of biomarkers** that correlate with patient response
  - Need strategies for .green[patient stratification]

&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;

.little.purple[Rashevsky (1940). Mathematical biophysics in its relation to the cancer problem]

???

- Models + experiments hand-in-hand paradigm
- Models are a mix of **Mathematics** (theory) and **computational** (software) tools
- Model-experiment (data production) iterative refinement pattern/cycle
  - Use models can make new predictions and drive new hypotheses for further experimental investigations (**faster and with less cost**) and **guide us towards more informative experiments**
  - 2 **optimization** self-loops can be used in both models and experiments nodes
- Rashevsky (1940) talks about:
1. The usefulness of theoretical research for experimental science
2. Mathematical study of cell division and its relation to cancer

# Goals of computational cancer modeling

![:scale 85%](img/trial-lecture/goals_cancer_modeling.svg)

???

- Be **explanatory/mechanistic**
- Predict new therapies (e.g. **identify new targets** or synergistic drug combinations)
- Personalized treatment: **optimal drug-patient match**
- Patient stratification (biomarkers) - **overcome patient diversity**
- Optimize clinical trial design (e.g. **better dosing schedules, optimize chemotherapy delivery, reduce drug toxicity**)
- Deliver robust and reproducible results
  - **VVUQ**: verification, validation (match observations) and uncertainty quantification .small.purple[Groen (2021)]

- Moving towards **multiscale hybrid modeling**

???

### Granularity in species' states and treatment of time

.small[
1. **Logical modeling**
  - .purple[Kauffman (1969)] - seminal paper in the field
  - Discrete time steps and active/inactive outputs (e.g. Boolean 0/1) - can also be multi-valued
  - .green[Easy rule formulation, high interpretability, less+discretized data data are needed for training]
  - .green[Attractors are **biologically meaningful**]:
      - Representing specific phenotypic outputs
      - Transitions between system states like in the cell cycle or differentiation of cell types (T cell differentiation)
  - **GINsim**, and other tools, see **CoLoMoTo** .purple[Naldi (2018)] paper
2. **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**
  - Time is an independent, continuous variable 
  - Species concentrations are the unknowns
  - .red[Need for data (kinetic rates, concentration parameters)]
  - Software **Tellurium** (.purple[Choi (2018)]): ODE solving, parameter estimation, visualization
3. **Mixed Discrete-Continuous (hybrid) modeling**
  - .green[Pro: Simplicity of logical modeling without the need to specify kinetic rates, but still output is continuous]
  - Example 1: Logic-ODEs .purple[Wittmann (2009)]
  - Example 2: Fuzzy Modeling .purple[Morris (2016)]
  - Example 3: Stochastic Boolean Modeling (MaBoSS 2.0 .purple[Stoll (2017)])
  - **CellNOpt** .purple[Gjerga (2020)]: software that offers a lot of the above example frameworks + training and optimizing models to perturbation data
]

### PDEs and Stochastic models

.small[
- **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**
  - Time + space as unknown variables, .red[hard to solve in general]
  - Example 1: **Calcium (Ca2+)**, a fundamental intracellular signal, that achieves specificity over wide temporal and spatial changes
  - Example 2: Cell geometry, compartments (e.g. in whole-cell modeling)
- **Stochastic modeling**
  - Reaction processes are not deterministic .green[More realistic models]
  - .green[Molecular quantities are low] (#species &lt;100-1000)
  - .red[Need to solve the even harder **CME (Chemical Master Equation)**]: distribution of species across time and space
  - Approximate solutions: stochastic simulation algorithm (**Gillespie** algorithm + variations)
  - Particle-based methods (MD: **Molecular Dynamics**: solve equations for every atom in the system!)
]

### Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)

.small[
- **Autonomous agents** freely interacting with one another over time and space by exchanging messages
- Environment is non-deterministic, so **agents have to learn and adapt their behavior** to achieve their goals
- .green[ABM is intuitive for multi-cellular modeling (cells as agents)]
- .red[Complex nature of agent interactions =&gt; lack of mechanistic interpretation]
- .red[Very computationally intensive] (tracking agents across space and time)
]

### Structural/network vs dynamical/mechanistic models
  
.small[
- Structural models are network-based (connectivity)
  - .green[Exploit topological properties (e.g. graph theory) to derive associations/prove hypotheses/make predictions]
- Dynamical are mathematical models (so networks + equations)
]

### White-box vs Black-box models
.small[
- .red[Accuracy vs. Interpretability trade-off]
- White-box: **mechanistic/hypothesis-driven**, use knowledge
  - ODEs, Boolean modeling, simple statistical models (linear regression, decision trees)
- Black-box: **empirical/data-driven**, .red[use A LOT of data]
  - Random forests, NNs, Deep Learning
- Grey-box: new Neural Network approaches
]

### Area of application

.small[
- **Tumor growth**, metabolism, vasculature, **microenvironment, immunity**, invasion, **treatment and resistance**, etc.
- Important for considering the modeling framework
]

### Multiscale hybrid modeling

.small[
- Moving from **scale-specific** to **multiscale models**
- Incorporating different biological scales is important for **clinical translation**
- **Software** for multiscale modeling:
  - .green[Example]: Use ODEs or logical models for intracellular signaling and agent-based modeling (ABM) for interactions between cells (**PhysiBoSS** = PhysiCell + MaBoSS, see .purple[Letort (2018)])
  - **COPASI** (.purple[Hoops (2006)]): ODEs and stochastic simulations or hybrids of these
  - **Chaste: Cancer, Heart and Soft Tissue Environment** .purple[Cooper (2020)]
      - Cardiac electrophysiology
      - Cell-based modeling, application in tissue carcinogenesis
      - Multiscale lung ventilation simulations
  - **Virtual Cell** .purple[Blinov (2017)] (rule-based framework): combines ODEs + Stochastic + agent-based modeling.

.small.purple[Game of Life, John Conway]

???

- Game of Life is a famous **Cellular Automaton (CA)**, demonstrating how complexity can arise from simple rules
- **Epilog** .purple[Varela (2018)]: software that defines an CA in 2D to represent a multi-cellular environment using a logical model framework for describing cell behavior

# Mixed Discrete-Continuous Modeling

- Logic-ODEs (Eduati's paper or Tognetti's paper?)
- MaBoSS: Bael's 2021 paper?

---

# ODE Modeling (vs standard black-box ML)

- Frolich 2018 paper

---

# ??????

- gene mutation data (patient specificity) =&gt; don't deal with the interactions


---

# Multi-cell application in cancer

- Agent-based modeling? (a PhysiCell paper)

# Machine Learning

combo-FM paper or Yang2020 (black-box ML)

(or maybe not, first the next)

&gt; The potential machine learning (ML) or artificial
intelligence (AI) applications to healthcare have
recently received particular notice in the media
with **IBM’s Watson**, applications to radiology and
diagnoses aided by wearable technology amongst
many others. Each of these examples are exciting, but
the full promise of personalized medicine remains
unrealized. While the amount and types of clinical data
being generated for each cancer patient is increasing
dramatically, there are no holistic approaches or
algorithms available that can incorporate all this data
to identify the best treatment for each individual
patient. There are, obviously, many reasons for this,
but a critical challenge is that cancer is a spatially
complex, adaptive process and the data being collected,
while vast, is quite limited in that it is showing, at best,
infrequent snapshots of extremely small regions of
the tumor. Ultimately, this means AI and ML models
will not be able to be trained on the right data to make
reliable predictions.

# Models don't have to be complex

Quote from Fitzgerald et al (2006):

&gt; Lest one be tempted simply to wait for ‘final’ models to emerge, it
is worth remembering that "all models are wrong; some are useful" [Box (1979)]. We specifically reject the critique that experimentally validated mathematical analysis of cellular networks will be useful only when ‘complete’ models of cells or tissues are available. **Quantitative modeling of bridges and buildings was essential for mechanical engineering long before it was practical to represent every beam and bolt or to understand the atomic properties of steel**. Whatever the limitations of emerging mathematical models of cellular physiology, they will almost certainly be better guides for drug development than the prevailing practice of representing biochemistry pictorially and reporting network interactions piecemeal.
