## The Course: ML in Medical Bioinformatics

- Offered by **MedBioInfo** (The Swedish Research School in Medical Bioinformatics)
- <font color="green">**Location</font>: Linköping University, Sweden**
- Access the course material [here](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1308611)
- Easy to intermediate level
- Covers the most essential/practical ML for applications
- <font color="green">**Excellent lecturers**</font>
  - **Manuela Zucknick (Statistician)**
  - **Claudio Mirabello (NN expert)**
- Almost non-medical ... but I highly recommend it nonetheless!

## Before the Course

### [Preparatory tasks](https://github.com/bjornwallner/ML_medbioinfo) **(1 week)**
- Most tasks were **Python-based**
- Use [scikit-learn module](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html) 
for teaching ML

### **Reading**
- James et al. (2013). [An Introduction to Statistical Learning – with Applications in R. Springer](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Michael Nielsen (online book)](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)

## During the course

### Practical Exercises
- Use [jupyter-notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
- <font color="green">Discussion</font>: **R vs Python for ML (beginners vs advanced)**
- Know your data, know your methods!

### Applications in research and reproducibility (**R**)
- [Aure et al (2015), Integrated analysis reveals microRNA networks coordinately expressed with 
  key proteins in breast cancer](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-015-0135-5)
  
### Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- [Tensor Flow Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org)
- [Keras: The Python Deep Learning library](https://keras.io/)

## Feature Importance 
... or why John participated in the course!

### <font color="red"> **Can ML help us find biomarkers?** </font>

### <font color="coral"> **Methods** </font>

- **Variable selection**
  - Correlation plots between the features and the response
  - <font color="green">**Linear Regression Models with Regularization (LASSO, Elastic Nets)**</font>
- <font color="green">**Random Forests**</font> (feature selection is embedded in decision trees)
- Use  <font color="green">**combination of methods!**</font>
-  <font color="green">**Neural Networks**</font> can also work but need a lot of engineering
