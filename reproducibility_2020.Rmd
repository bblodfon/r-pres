# Science as a Tale

.pull-right.large[
- Great Scientists are like granpas with good old tales!
<br><br>
- Elements of a good story
<br><br>
- Science dissemination (a historical perspective)
<br><br>
- Techonological progress
]

???
- Elements of a good story: concise, easy to rememeber, *carries a central message* that others can carry further on, there is some **magic** to it that captivates you
- Science dissemination has changed: from **text (story)** now we have to present **evidence** (experiments, be it computational or lab) that accompany it (even in Math some proofs are now computational).
That has brought a challenge: **experiments that cannot be reproduced are blocking progress**.
- Paradigm shift in Science dissemination with techonology's progress has brought more challenges (**Material and Methods in papers, presenting reports**, etc...)

# Crisis in Science?

.large[Research on Research: **meta-research**]
--

- Why Most Published Research Findings Are .red[False] .purple[Ioannidis (2005)]
- Most of the proposed associations and/or effects are either .red[False or exaggerated] .purple[Ioannidis (2008)]
- Estimated .red[85%] of research resources are wasted! .purple[Macleod et. al (2014)]

--

.blue.large[LIKELY CAUSES]:

- Methods not well explained  
- Insufficient data sharing (access policies)  
- Links don't work (resources access)  
- Results are **not reproducible** 
.  
.  
.  


.large[Welcome to the .red[Reproducibility Wars] era!]

???
- *are either False or exaggerated* => False here means False Positives
- Ioannidis (2005): statistical analysis based on modeling the Framework for False Positive Findings finds the **key factors that make most research findings to be FALSE**: pre-study odds, bias and study power (they all relate to **PPV** - prob. of a statistical significant research finding to be TRUE)
- Claimed Research Findings May Often Be Simply Accurate Measures of the Prevailing Bias [Ioannidis2005]

# How to make more published research true?

.larger[*“To make more published research true, practises [should] include the adoption of large-scale collaborative research; replication culture, registration; sharing, reproducibility practices; better statistical methods; standardization of definitions and analyses; more appropriate (usually more stringent) statistical thresholds; and improvement in study design standards, peer review, reporting and dissemination of research and training of the scientific workforce.”*]

**Research Currencies**: need for a better *Reward system* for Science]

- Advice by Ioannidis: based on a reproducibility Nature study => read only Nature & Science and cut the results (effect-wise) in half!

# .small[Top 5 Tips to Make Your Research (Ir)-reproducible!] .tiny.red[a non-exhaustive list!]

.larger[
1. Think “**Big Picture**”
2. Be **abstract**
3. Short and sweet
4. The deficit model
5. **Don't share**
]

.larger[.blue[Top Tip]: *“to ensure your work is irreproducible, make sure that you cannot reproduce it yourself”*]

--

.larger[.blue[Sad Outcome]: *“After Publishing Research, Irreproducibility Lets False Observations Obtain Longevity!”*]

???
1. Don't describe experimental stuff, people are interested in Science!
2&3. No need to show all the **subtle implementation details** and expose the limitations to your methods
4. **Hierarchy** of experts and non-experts (you are the expert, you define what is what, benchmarks, etc.)
5. Other people to scoop your research ideas, understand how your code actually works instead of why you say it does, or worst of all to understand that **your code doesn’t actually work at all**.

# Remember: Reproducibility needs work!

Find the *balance* between work and validation/reproducibility!

???
Reproducibility (should be easy to achieve) vs Replicability (difficult) argument

# Example 0: Using the Docker Technology

- Image
- Docker as a Future-proof container of knowledge
- The CoLoMoTo Docker

---
# Example 1: A Reproducible Report in R

- .purple[rtemps]

Use Github and Github pages
1 Figure = 1000 words
Nobody needs to see your code but it needs to be there (button hide)
Cite your References
Make sure your links work
CSS Color boxes + notes for important messages (capture reader's attention)
TOC (always on the left, provides an abstract view of report)
