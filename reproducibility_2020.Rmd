# Science as a Tale

.pull-right.larger[
- Great Scientists are like granpa's with good old' tales!
<br><br>
- Elements of a good story
<br><br>
- Science dissemination (historical perspective)
<br><br>
- Techonological progress
]

???
- Elements of a good story: concise, easy to rememeber, *carries a central message* that others can carry further on, there is some **magic** to it that captivates you
- Science dissemination has changed: from **text (story)** now we have to present **evidence** (experiments, be it computational or lab) that accompany it (even in Math some proofs are now computational).
That has brought a challenge: **experiments that cannot be reproduced are blocking progress**.
- Paradigm shift in Science dissemination with techonology's progress has brought more challenges (**Material and Methods in papers, presenting reports**, etc...)

# Crisis in Science?

- Research on Reserach: A meta-research perspective
--

- Why Most Published Research Findings Are .red[False] [Ioannidis (2005)]
- Most of the proposed associations and/or effects are either .red[False or exaggerated] [Ioannidis (2008)]
- Estimated /red[85%] of research resources are wasted! [Macleod et. al (2014)]
--

What causes this crisis?

- Methods not well explained
- Insufficient data sharing (access policies)
- Links don't work
- Results are not reproducible
--

- The Reproducibility Wars era!

???
- *are either False or exaggerated* => False here means False Positives
- Ioannidis (2005) provides statistical arguments based on modeling the Framework for False Positive Findings (general meta-research perspective)
- Also in Crisis: results are not reproducible - worse you get different results (with big data the so-called Janus effect)!

# How to make more published research true?

.larger[*“To make more published research true, practises [should] include the adoption of large-scale collaborative research; replication culture, registration; sharing, reproducibility practices; better statistical methods; standardization of definitions and analyses; more appropriate (usually more stringent) statistical thresholds; and improvement in study design standards, peer review, reporting and dissemination of research and training of the scientific workforce.”*]

[Ioannidis (2014)]

--

- Stakeholders: Diverse Motives (peer review?)
- Research Currencies: a better Reward system for Science

???

- Advice by Ioannidis: based on a reproducibility Nature study => read only Nature & Science and cut the results (effect-wise) in half!

# .small[Top Tips to Make Your Research (Ir)-reproducible!] .tiny.red[a non-exhaustive list!]

.large[
1. Think “Big Picture”
2. Be abstract
3. Short and sweet
4. The deficit model
5. Don't share
]

.larger[.blue[Top Tip]: *“to ensure your work is irreproducible, make sure that you cannot reproduce it yourself”*]

--

.larger[.blue[Sad Outcome]: *“After Publishing Research, Irreproducibility Lets False Observations Obtain Longevity!”*]

???
1. Don't describe experimental stuff, people are interested in Science!
2&3. No need to show all the **subtle implementation details** and expose the limitations to your methods
4. **Hierarchy** of experts and non-experts (you are the expert, you define what is what, benchmarks, etc.)
5. Other people to scoop your research ideas, understand how your code actually works instead of why you say it does, or worst of all to understand that **your code doesn’t actually work at all**.

# Reproducibility needs work!

<img src="https://thecodinglove.com/content/038/SLFSVsF.gif">

Find the *balance* between doing the work and validation/reproducibility!

???
- Reproducibility (should be easy to achieve) vs Replicability (difficult) argument
