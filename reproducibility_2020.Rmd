# Reproducibility

- Crisis in Science: Most of the statistically significant results are either FP (false positives) or exaggerated [Ioannidis2]
- Estimated 85% of research resources are wasted!
- Reproducibility vs Replicability
- New era: The Reproducibility Wars (Replication crisis)
- How to make more published research true? [Ioannidis (2014)]

???
- Advice by Ioannidis: based on a reproducibility Nature study => read only Nature & Science and cut the results (effect-wise) in half!
- Also in Crisis: Methods in papers are not well explained, no data sharing (access policies), links don’t work, libraries are deprecated, results are not reproducible - worse you get different results (with big data the so-called Janus effect)!

# Reproducibility

“To make more published research true, practises [should] include the adoption of large-scale collaborative research; replication culture, registration; sharing, reproducibility practices; better statistical methods; standardization of definitions and analyses; more appropriate (usually more stringent) statistical thresholds; and improvement in study design standards, peer review, reporting and dissemination of research and training of the scientific workforce.”

[Ioannidis (2014)]
